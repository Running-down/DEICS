Development, Validation, and Clinical Evaluation of a Machine-Learning-Based Model for Diagnosing Early Infection After Cardiovascular Surgery (DEICS)
This repository contains the resources and supplementary materials related to the study titled:
"Development, validation, and clinical evaluation of a machine-learning-based model for diagnosing early infection after cardiovascular surgery (DEICS): a multi-center cohort study."

Overview
This study introduces and evaluates a machine-learning-based model for diagnosing early infections (within 48 hours post-surgery) in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The research leverages clinical and laboratory data from multiple centers to validate the model's accuracy, generalizability, and potential for simplifying diagnosis in a high-risk patient population.

Key Objectives:
Develop a machine-learning model to identify early infections with high sensitivity and specificity.
Validate the model across diverse patient populations in a multi-center cohort.
Explore the use of proxy variables for potential simplification and improved clinical usability.
